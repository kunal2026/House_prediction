# House Price Prediction Project
#### This repository contains code for predicting house prices using a machine learning model based on various features of houses.

## Dataset
#### The dataset used for this project includes various features such as number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and location among others. The dataset is split into a training set and a test set for model evaluation.

## Code
#### The main script for this project is House-prediction.ipynb, which performs the following steps:

Data Loading: Loads the house price dataset from a CSV file.
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and preprocesses the data, handling missing values and encoding categorical variables if necessary.
Feature Selection/Engineering: Selects relevant features or performs feature engineering to improve model performance.
Model Training: Trains a machine learning model (e.g., linear regression, random forest) on the training set.
Model Evaluation: Evaluates the trained model using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) on the test set.
Prediction: Provides functionality to make predictions on new data points using the trained model.
Installation
